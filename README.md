# Silicium

Ruby Math Library written as exercise by MMCS students.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'silicium'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install silicium

## Usage
###   Graphs

#### Graph initialization
To create an empty graph just initialize an object:
```ruby
    g = OrientedGraph.new
    g = UnorientedGraph.new
````
Of course, you can determine vertices (name them whatever you want!). To do that, write something like:
```ruby
    g = OrientedGraph.new([{v: 0,     i: [:one]},
                          {v: :one,  i: [0, 'two']},
                          {v: 'two', i: [0, 'two']}])
```
You have to pass an `Array` of `Hashes`, each hash consists of pair of keys:
* v: vertex name;
* i: `Array` of adjacent vertices

Same goes for the case with unoriented graph (note that missing edges will be added automatically):
```ruby
    g = UnorientedGraph.new([{v: 0,     i: [:one]},
                           {v: :one,  i: [0, 'two']},
                           {v: 'two', i: [0, 'two']}])
```

 ```

 ```
* Breadth-First Search:
 ```ruby
     g.breadth_first_search?(graph, starting_vertex, searching_vertex)
 ```

```  
* Find Strongly Connected Components:
```ruby
     g.find_strongly_connected_components
```

* Topological sort

#### Description
Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge *u v*, vertex *u* comes before *v* in the ordering.

#### How to use
For you to have a topologically sorted graph, you need to create an object of the class ```Graph```:
``` ruby
    graph = Graph.new
```
Then you need to add vertices to this graph using the class ```Node```:
``` ruby
    graph.nodes << (node1 = Node.new(1))
    graph.nodes << (node2 = Node.new(2))
```
Due to the fact that only a directed graph can be sorted topologically, it is necessary to add an edge:
``` ruby
    graph.add_edge(node1, node2)
```
And finally you can type:
``` ruby
    TopologicalSortClass.new(graph)
```

#### Result
The result for ```TopologicalSortClass.new(graph).post_order.map(&:to_s)``` is [2, 1]

### Numerical integration

Library `Numerical integration` 
includes methods for numerical integration of functions, such as 3/8 method, Simpson method, left, right and middle rectangle methods and trapezoid method.

Each function accepts 4 parameters, such as left and right integration boundaries, default accuracy of 0.0001 and the function itself.
Example: `three_eights_integration(4, 5, 0.01) { |x| 1 / x }` or `three_eights_integration(4, 5) { |x| 1 / x }`

For example, to integrate 1 / x  in between [4, 5] using the 3/8 method, you need to use: 
`NumericalIntegration.three_eights_integration(4, 5) { |x| 1 / x }`

using the Simpson's method: 
`NumericalIntegration.simpson_integration(4, 5) {  |x| 1 / x  }`

using the left rectangle method: 
`NumericalIntegration.left_rect_integration(4, 5) {  |x| 1 / x  }`

using the right rectangle method: 
`NumericalIntegration.right_rect_integration(4, 5) {  |x| 1 / x  }`

using the middle rectangle method:
`NumericalIntegration.middle_rectangles(4, 5) {  |x| 1 / x  }`

using the trapezoid method: 
`NumericalIntegration.trapezoid(4, 5) {  |x| 1 / x  }`


### Polynomial interpolation 
Library `polynomial_interpolation` 
includes methods for two types of polynomial such 
Lagrange polynomial and Newton polynomial

Each function accepts 3 parameters, such as 
array of data points, array returned by function
and the node to interpolate. 

using the lagrange_polynomials method: 
`lagrange_polynomials([-1, 0, 1, 4], [-7, -1, 1, 43], 2 )`

using the newton_polynomials method: 
`newton_polynomials([-1, 0, 1, 2], [-9, -4, 11, 78],  0.1 )`

## Module BernoulliTrials

Module allows find the probability of an event occurring a certain number of times for any number of independent trials.

```
n - count of independent trials
k - count of successful events
p - probability of succesful event (k / n)
q - probability of bad event (1 - p)

We have either the probability of event (p) or datas to calculate it (p = suc / all)

For small n probability is calculated by the Bernoulli formula C(n,k) * (p ^ k) * (q ^ (n-k))
For big n probability is calsulated by the Laplace theorem f((k - n*p)/sqrt(n*p*q)) / sqrt(n*p*q) 
Auxiliary Gaussian function F(x) = exp(-(x^2/2)) / sqrt(2*PI), F(-x) = F(x)

Laplace theorem give satisfactory approximation for n*p*q > 9
```

Example

```
--- Number 1 ---
Probability of making a detail of excellent quality is 0.75.
Probability that out of 400 parts, 280 will be of high quality.

n = 400, k = 280, p = 0.75, q = 0.25

n * p * q > 9, that Laplace theorem

F((280-300) / sqrt(75)) = F(-2.31) = F(2.31) = F(exp(-(2.31^2)/2) / sqrt(2*3.14)) = 0.0277
P = 0.0277 / sqrt(75) = 0.0032

--- Number 2 ---
Of 100 batteries, 7 breaks down during a year of storage.
Choose 5 batteries at random. 
Probability that among them 3 are serviceable.

n = 5, k = 3, all = 100, suc = 7
p = 7 / 100 = 0.07, q = 0.93

n * p * q < 9, that Bernoulli formula
P = C(5,3) * (0.93^3) * (0.07^2) = 0.0394
```


### Matrix

#### Method Gauss and Kramer

We have added Two methods for solving a system of linear equations: Gauss and Kramer.

The Gauss method is implemented as a function, and the Kramer rule is implemented as a method for the Matrix class.

To use the Gauss method, you need to call it with a single argument-the matrix whose roots you want to find.

##### Example 
```ruby
gauss_method_sol(Matrix[[1,2,3,4,5],[0,1,-1,2,3],[0,1,-1,2,3],[0,2,-2,4,6]].row_vectors
```
##### Answer
```ruby
[-1,3,0,0]
```

To use Kramer's rule, you need to call it as a method of the Matrix class with an array argument containing the values of each expression of a system of linear equations
##### Example 
```ruby
Matrix[[2, -5, 3], [4, 1, 4], [1, 2, -8]].kramer([7,21,-11]
```
##### Answer
```ruby
[3,1,2]
```

### Machine Learnign Algorithms

### Backpropogation 
When you need to compute a gradient value for a really huge expression, that a good practise to use a backpropogation algorithm to enhance the speed and quality of work. First, you needed a construct a Computational Graph, what makes our works more effective than it will be by using a  common Gradient Decent
```ruby
my_graph = Comp_Graph.new("(x*W1+b1)*W2+b2")
```
Than, we initialize our parametrs:
```ruby
    variables = Hash["x",1.0,"W1",1.0,"b1",1.0,"W2",1.0,"b2",1.0]
```
Finally, we can start to start training! The values will pass forward throw the graph and return the result of results of neural net(in theory)
```ruby
    computed_value = my_graph.ForwardPass(variables)
```

When it's done, we can use it to compute the curreny of result by loss function(at this example it's just a half of difference between values) and than start to move back, but now we compute the gradient value
```ruby
    trivial_loss = (expected_value - computed_value) * 0.5
    grad =  my_graph.BackwardPass(trivial_loss)
```

That's it! The last thing to do is apply gradient value to inserted parametrs, depended on value of learning speed(learn_rate)
```ruby
    learn_rate = 0.01
    variables["W1"] += grad["W1"]*learn_rate
    variables["W2"] += grad["W2"]*learn_rate
    variables["b1"] += grad["b1"]*learn_rate
    variables["b2"] += grad["b2"]*learn_rate
```
After a lot of repeating we will move closer to the perfect values of hyperparametrs in the net

### Optimization

#### Karatsuba multiplication
The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm. It reduces the multiplication of two n-digit numbers to at most ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Theta(n^{1.58}))  single-digit multiplications in general. It is therefore faster than the traditional algorithm, which requires ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Theta(n^{2})) single-digit products.

##### Example:
```ruby
   karatsuba(15, 15) #returns 225
```
